\section{Version 1.0.0}{
  This is the initial release version. The purpose of this package is to provide Quality Control of sequencing samples by deducing whether there is batch effect and adjust for it in the best possible way. The package includes the following features.
  \itemize{
    \item Summary and Sample Diagnostics
    \item Differential Expression Plots and Analysis using LIMMA
    \item Principal Component Analysis and plots to check batch effects
    \item Heatmap plot of gene expressions
    \item Median Correlation Plot
    \item Circular Dendrogram clustered and colored by batch and condition
    \item Shape Analysis for the distribution curve based on HTShape package
    \item Batch Adjustment using ComBat
    \item Surrogate Variable Analysis using sva package
    \item Function to generate simulated RNA-Seq data
